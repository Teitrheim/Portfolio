        <p class="about-text">
            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Thomas Eitrheim. I find immense joy in everything about front-end
            development and is dedicated to creating engaging
            and
            responsive web experiences. This website showcases my projects and skills developed during my first year
            of
            studying at Noroff.

        <p class="about-text">
            I believe in clean and efficient code to bring all my ideas to life. Feel free to explore my work
            and
            get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities.

                <p>🌟 One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
                    compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</p>
